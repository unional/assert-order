...sometimes we do need to assert code are executed in certain order.

This is the library for that.

```ts
import AssertOrder from 'assert-order'

let a = new AssertOrder()

function doSomething() { a.any(5, 6) }

a.once(0)
a.once(1)
a.some(2)
a.some(2)
a.all(3, 2)
a.all(3, 2)
a.once(4)
doSomething()
doSomething()

a = new AssertOrder(2)
a.once(0)
setTimeout(() => a.once(1), 10)

// Wait for 50 millisecond before verifying.
a.end(50)
```

## Contribute

```sh
# right after fork
npm install

# begin making changes
git checkout -b <branch>

## Npm Commands

There are a few useful commands you can use during development.

```sh
# Run tests (and lint) automatically whenever you save a file.
npm run watch

# Run tests with coverage stats (but won't fail you if coverage does not meet criteria)
npm run test

# Manually verify the project.
# This will be ran during 'npm preversion' so you normally don't need to run this yourself.
npm run verify

# Build the project.
# You normally don't need to do this.
npm run build

# Run tslint
# You normally don't need to do this as `npm run watch` and `npm version` will automatically run lint for you.
npm run lint
```
